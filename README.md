## Notes

NOTE: some of the components are not used, but we can use them in the future.
NOTE02: we are using tailwindcss for styling, so we don't need to create a lot of css files.
NOTE03: we are using nextjs13, so consider taking advantage of server components and api routes.
NOTE04: for the client side data fething we used swr for caching and revalidation.
NOTE05: for the forms use @formiz lib and validate with valibot.

## AUTH

i've not used any auth lib, i've created a simple auth flow with nextjs api routes and cookies.
the entire process is to save the auth_token [no matter the auth flow] once we get it from the openchat api we save it in browser.  
the problem that we want to sync the cookie with the server side ["nextjs"], so we can use it in the server side rendering.
so i created login api endpoint inside api/ dir and let nextjs to set the cookie via set-Cookie header [the same value that we set in the browser].

## when the user considered logged in?

- if we have the auth_token in the browser and the server side, then the user is logged in.
- and the auth_token is valid. [all valid for now due to backend issues].

## when the user considered logged out?

- if we don't have the auth_token in the browser and the server side.[checking the cookie value in the server (in server requests) and client(in client requests)].
- if the response status code is 401 [need adjustments for role based auth].
NOTE: if the user tries to remove the cookie maually from the browser we will detect it[when the window gains focus after being blured] we will check if the cookie is removed or not, if it's removed we will logout the user immediately.

## animations

regading the animations i've used framer-motion lib instead of tailwindcss-animate pulgin, it's easy to use and it's the best for react apps.
